    <p>
	We, as a whole, need to collaborate and affiliate ourselves with one another. We need to take a stand against what is right and what is wrong. Not just the things that are ethically wrong, but also the ones that are morally wrong. We need to join together, as one group. One community. One state. One nation. Rise above the injustices that you see, rise above those who put you down, rise above those who tell you your best is not good enough. Because in reality, these socialist, antagonizing, demeaning, ill minded  social networks won't tell you these things.
</p>

<p>
	You need to tell yourself that the best you can do, is you. You don't need to change for someone else's preference or what they see fit. They are not you. They cannot control you. You are not a machine. You are not a computer. You are are not data than can be easily manipulated. You are you. You need to find yourself in this hellhole we live in. Do it in a beneficial way, to not just you, but others.
</p>

<p>
	Don't lie. Don't manipulate. Don't discriminate. Don't bully. Don't disrespect your parents, your loved ones, or those who are in your lives. Cherish them till the end. Treat them as if they are the world to you, because they are. Wants. Desires. Dreams.  Realities. Wishes. These all come with help. Don't just expect people to help you for nothing in return. Help others. Don't just pass opportunities to help people. People need help, as do you. When you are in need, one person will always be there for you. Will you be that same person to someone else?
</p>

<p>
	Defend. Defend your honor. Defend your freedom. Defend your nation. Defend your pride. Defend your religion. Defend your race. Defend your rights. Defend you.  Defend everything you live for and everyone you love. Will you sacrifice yourself for all of these things, or will you just stand where you stand today, in complete shock, with no knowledge or desire to know what is happening around you?
</p>

<p>
	Learn. Educate. Teach. Absorb. Take in what you learn and distribute it to the world around you. Enlighten people with your education and show them your meaning in life. Make people know you for who you are, not what you want to be. That person is not you, it is a figment of your imagination. That person that you want to be, does not exist. That person is a reflexion of all the impurities in our society.  You are you and you can not be someone else, no matter how hard you try. You are the best that can come, don't let others change that person inside you, to confirm that the person inside them is the best. The person that exists inside you is the best thing that can be. Never change for those around you. Because if you do, you are no longer you.
</p>

<p>
	Enjoy. Experience. Travel. Venture. Venture into the world. The world is a beautiful place. Don't experience the world in the eyes if the beholder, experience it through your eyes. You need to take action for your adventures, not have a guide all along the way. You need to take a step off the forged path that you follow and travel into unknown territory and take the risk of becoming lost. Because in reality, the path will always be there for your escape back into the unfit reality of the "follow the leader" life style we live in today. Just take the risk of being your own guide in your life with no directions from anyone or anything. Venture out into those paths that have yet to be forged or walked on by others. Be your own guide.
</p>

<p>
	Respect. Love. Hate. Relationships. Discrimination. Disregard. Disregard all those comments about you. About how you "get around", your attitude, your life style, your relationships, your sexuality, your secrets, your choices, your way of being and how you see the world. They are not important. Do not ever let them get in the way of your dreams and your wishes. Those comments are all demeanors of the people trying to get the best of you, to make you think you are not perfect in this unjust and uncivil society. You cannot take these insults or any negative connotations towards you to heart. You need to rise above the world that is so sought out to bring you down. Show them that you are a building that cannot be broken down with small minded rocks. You are a stone building, with so many complexities inside that most people won't understand you. But those that do, will accept you for who you are and will always love you in any situation that you put yourself through.
</p>

<p>
	People come and go, but that one person, the one that makes you happy beyond belief, will be there for eternity, helping you along the way. There is someone out there that is exactly like that. With that pure heart and soul that you are searching for. They are here, on this earth, now. Don't give up trying to find that one person that will complete your fantasies, into realities and make all your dreams come true. They are breathing the same air as you, they are living off the same sun as you, and they are living on the same planet as you. That person does exist. Don't ever give up in the fight to survive or the fight for love. You need to survive to love and you need to love to survive.
</p>

<p>
Live. Breath. Think. Look. Listen. These are all things that your heart and soul are needed for them to work. It's you as a person that makes your life meaningful. Not those around you. You have a chance to choose what is right. You have a chance to determine your future. You have chance to make the situations in your favor. You have a chance to live your life, through your eyes, not through someone else's. You have a chance to be happy and enjoy all the opportunities that come your way. You have the choice to live, breathe, and experience the world as it is. Guidance will always be there from someone if need be. But don't rely on guidance.
<br>Choose your own paths, with some help along the way, but for the majority, choose your path, your life, your future. Live your life. Make it your own. Because We are Humans. We are joined on this earth by each other.  We need to understand that in times of need, it is necessary to come together, but when there's no commotion or needing of others, we need to journey onto our own paths and explore the road that is at our feet that has been touched by no one. 10/15/12

                                <h4 id="blogtitle1">The No-No Incident</h4>

                                <p>So one day I was at the field. I was taking a break from the great day I was having, when I went to go watch some kids playing 1v1s. I have been apart of them and have watched many in my time, but these kids had no clue what they were doing.</p>

                                <p>One kid had a fully automatic gun and the other had a semi auto gun. Instead of playing strategically, they both started jumping and rolling around in attempt to get a trick shot. It just looked ridiculous and they were wasting a lot of time goofing off on the good field.</p>

                                <p>After a good few minutes of these little rugrats running around it happened....</p>

                                <p>At first, you would have thought the world ended or that he was trying to hit the high note of a song, but unfortunately, he got hit right in the mister no-nos, and fell to the ground with a shriek of terror and pain.</p>

                                <p>I fell on the floor in pain too, but my pain was from laughter. Never will I forget that day.</p>

                        <h4 id="blogtitle2">My First Tournament</h4>

                        <p>I was always in love with the breaks of the professionals and how they spread out like nothing. There is nothing more satisfying to me than the noise of the consistant shots going off at the beginnin of each round.</p>

                        <p>I finally got enough skill to join a team and participate in my first tournament. My nerves were at an all time high, and the craziest part about it was that it was a pump team...I literally bought my pump two weeks before the tournament because they decided to sign up for the pump bracket without telling me.</p>

                        <p>So not only was it my first tournament, but it was one of the first times I was playing with a pump. I have used a semi auto gun for yeas and all of the sudden I need to approach everything differently. It was crazy to me that it happened.</p>

                        <p>In all honesty, I probably only got 4 kills the whole tournament because our breaks were quick and also got us killed easily. More times than not it was only me against most of the opposing team, which did not end well.</p>

                        <p>Somehow and someway, a team of kids who played with semi auto guns 985 of the time, ended up getting third place in the tournament. Who knows how it happened, but it did.</p>

                        <p>I got into paintball at a young age, while none of my friends joined in on it. So I would go to the field by myself. I was not scared or shy so I enjoyed the alone time.</p>

                        <p>One day it was like 110 degrees outside, but I still decided to go to the field and have a good time. I was doing good and having a good time, but I got hurt...when I was sitting down waiting for my game to end after I got out already.</p>

                        <p>I got hit in the back of my neck while I was sitting on the ground watching the game in front of me. I do not know why there was another game going on behind us when the fields were so close together, but it happened and I passed out.</p>

                        <p>I woke up behind the check-in booth in the front of the park, and was just laying there for a good hour or two while I recovered and drank water. While I was sitting there, one of the workers caught a rattlesnake. He decided he was going to skin it right in front of me to make a headband out of his scales.</p>
                                
                        <p>Not only was I 15, but it was just bizzare. He cut the head off like nothing, then gutted the snake in front of my eyes. He then took the skin, and wrapped it around his head, then walked away.</p>
                                
                        <p>Let's just say I never went back to that field.</p>

                                <h4 id="blogtitle4">The Rich Kid</h4>

                                <p>I had this friend that I got to know from the field, through another friend. He always had the newest and most expensive gear, guns, masks, and anything you could think of.</p>

                                <p>His dad would literally buy him anything he wanted and he would brag 24/7 about everything he got. I had a cheap $200 gun set up and did not care. I just wanted to get better and better.</p>

                                <p>He was so arrogant and cocky, but little did he know that he was the least talented player I have ever seen. I do not think I ever saw him hit someone. He always stayed in the back, yelled, and constantly fired, wasting all of his paint every round. He wouldgo through 5 boxes a day, while I would make one box last 2 weekends.</p>

                                <p>Just goes to show that money does not buy you skills.</p>
